StealTools is a collection of command-line utilities
that make building, packaging, and sharing ES6, CommonJS, AMD, and [Steal](https://github.com/bitovi/steal/tree/systemjs)
applications easy.

## Use

Currently, StealTools depends 
on [StealJS](https://github.com/bitovi/steal/tree/systemjs). Before doing a build, make
sure StealJS loads your app successfully in the browser.

### Hello World

If you followed [StealJS's Hello World Example](https://github.com/bitovi/steal/tree/systemjs),
the following will walk you through setting up StealTools to build that app.  That app has a 
structure that looks like:

    ROOT/
      bower.json
      bower_components/
      stealconfig.js
      index.html
      main.js

`stealconfig.js` is the config file and `main.js` is the main module.

1.  Install StealTools.

Using npm:

    > npm install steal-tools --save-dev

2.  Create a build script.

In your build script, add:

    var stealTools = require('steal-tools');
    stealTools.build({
      config: "path/to/ROOT/stealconfig.js",
      main: "main"
    }).then(function(){
      console.log("build is successful")
    })

Notice that the `config` option includes the path to the configuration file.  Your script
might want to use `__dirname`.  `stealTools.build` returns a deferred when the build is complete.

3. Run your build script.

This will produce a `ROOT/bundles/main.js`.

4. Switch to production.  

In `index.html`, switch to production by adding `data-env='production'` to the steal `<script>` tag:

    <script src='./bower_components/steal/steal.js'
            data-config='stealconfig.js'
            data-main='main'
            data-env-'production'></script>
